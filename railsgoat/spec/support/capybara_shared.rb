    ******************************************************************************
    You are running the RailsGoat Capybara Specs in Training mode. These specs
    are supposed to fail, indicating vulnerabilities exist. They contain spoilers,
    so do not read the code in spec/vulnerabilities if your goal is to learn more
    about patching the vulnerabilities. You should fix the vulnerabilities in the
    application in order to get these specs to pass**. You can use them to measure
    your progress.

    These same specs will pass if you set the #{maintainer_env_name} ENV variable.

    **NOTE: The RSpec pending feature is used to toggle the outcome of these specs
    between Training mode and RailsGoat Maintainer mode. When the vulnerabilities
    are removed, the specs will not "pass," but rather go into a "pending" state.
